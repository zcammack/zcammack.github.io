As a young child, I was always fascinated with technology. I grew up during the rise of the internet. I was told of a time before my birth where it was rare for people to have a phone in the house, much less a computer. In my own, it was a staple of our lives. We were a very tech forward family living in a small town that was largely behind the curve. It was during this time that I found my fascination... that the ability to speak with others, share ideas, and create unique experiences... all of it was possible with this machine I had at home.

I decided at a fairly young age that I wanted to know how it all worked. I wanted to understand why and how this machine was able to create such fantasy and give mankind the power to speak across impossible distance. It started from games as a child and grew with each passing day.I had been obsessed ever since I had opened my first application to simply doodle around in Paint.

As I grew older, that love for technology had never faded. I dedicated myself to learning as much as I could, going through college to learn Networking and routing technologies. While this was good, I felt as though it wasn't exactly what I had been pursuing. During my time at college, I found that I had an affinity for coding and opted to heelturn into a different area of technological expertise. 

The rest has been history. Late nights studying, long hours with terrible jobs, and an unwillingness to stop as I look forward to my dream. The dream of being able to build anything and everything within computers... and one day create something that will take the world by storm and change our lives for the better.
